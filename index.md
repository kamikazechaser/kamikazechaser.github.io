## About Me

I'm from Nairobi, Kenya. Known as Mohammed Sohail (or KamikazeChaser on the Internet). Currently a first year student pursuing a bachelor degree in Mechatronics Engineering. When I am not studying, I'm writing code. I ❤️ Football, [#GGMU](http://www.manutd.com/).

## Hardware History

I Made an [LFR robot](https://goo.gl/CU73WD) from scratch, which had no logic, but depended on the [L293D IC](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293.pdf) as a school project for Infomatrix Africa. I have also worked on modding PS3's, Xbox 360's and Nintendo 3DS's at [CyberMods](https://cybermods.co.ke) for the better part of 2016

## Programming History

I primarily do Web Development primarily using [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/), which is the server-side runtime for JavaScript, Node.JS redefined Javascript as a language, unlocking powerful potentials and a vast amount of libraries on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). I prefer making bots some of which are open source on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kamikazechaser). I have also made a few useless stuff with Python. I am currently toying around with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and C++ among many other interesting technologies.
